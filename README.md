# ReadME.md Generator

## Description 

This is a command line README generator that uses Node.js and Inquirer to ask a user questions about what they would like to put in each section of the README.md file and then creates the file. The example read me created is within the "examples" folder located within the "src" folder. 

Here is the live link to the video of the app running:
